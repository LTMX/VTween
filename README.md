# VTween
 Simple but fully functional tweening library for Unity3D. Inspired by the legendary LeanTween.  
 <br>**Why another tweening library?**</br>
 Well, LeanTween isn't maintained anymore and it doesn't work with UIToolkit(still the best tweening library in my heart!)  
 Note: This is not a direct replacement to LeanTween although the APIs are quite similar.
 
 
 **ToDo:**  
 - CustomYieldInstruction. Currently uses it's own timing. This the highest priority!  
 - Port more LeanTween apis.    
 - Support for UIToolkit is on the way! Have issues with unique ids due to it doesn't have InstanceID by default.
